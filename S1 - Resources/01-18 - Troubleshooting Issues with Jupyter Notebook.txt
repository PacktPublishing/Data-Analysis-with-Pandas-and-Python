Issue: Tab Completion / Intellisense does not work.

If you are unable to use the Tab key to autocomplete text or to see available methods on an object, paste and execute the following code in a cell within the Notebook.

%config Completer.use_jedi = False

This code disables a Python library called Jedi that may accidentally cause Tab Completion to fail.
