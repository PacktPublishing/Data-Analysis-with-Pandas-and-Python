First up, if you're looking for the CSV / XSLX datasets, they are available in a single zip file attached as a Resource to the first lesson in this course.

Many students have also requested the Jupyter Notebooks (the .ipynb files) that I created as I developed the course.

The Jupyter notebooks are contained in a single .zip file that is attached to this lesson as a resource.

Please note:

These files are NOT required to complete the course. They are completely optional and are provided for reference.

There will be some inconsistencies between the Notebooks and the videos -- certain lectures parts were improvised, others left out, others added in etc.

Nothing substitutes for practice. I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend watching the course videos and creating your own Jupyter Notebooks as you proceed.
